## Abstract

This work explores computer vision problems such as semantic segmentation and object detection and how both these different architectures can be combined in order to solve these problems in **parallel**. This work is helpful in the area of autonomous vehicles where the segmented map can show the path to move and object detection can detect cars and pedestrians. This approach is based on a **common _encoder_** that combines both the different architectures. While training the network, a dataset containing segmentation ground-truth and bounding box coordinates for each object in the image are passed such that segmented map and bounding boxes are predicted in parallel.
